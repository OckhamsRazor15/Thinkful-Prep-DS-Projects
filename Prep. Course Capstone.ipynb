    "The dataset I am working with is an aggregation from the 2016/17 and 2017/18 English Premier League seasons. The data was released by Football-Data.co.uk in 2 different csv files. The data represents statistics from all matches played in both seasons. The significance of looking at only 2 seasons is because the manager of Manchester City took over in the former season. Liverpool's coach was also the same in that period. \n",

    "These 2 coaches (Pep Guardiola - Man. City and Jurgen Klopp - Liverpool) have faced off before in the German 1st division (Bundesliga). While this data will not uncover all of the reasons behind Man. City's championship season in 17/18, it will provide a look into a slice. \n",
